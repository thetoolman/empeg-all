The MP3mobile&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H1>
This page documents my efforts at fitting my car with a MP3 player: I'm
still twiddling with lots of bits of the setup, and so this page will change
when things do with the setup. Hopefully, this page will help anyone else
trying to do the same thing! There are now some pictures (thanks to <A HREF="http://www.reality.demon.co.uk/">Patrick</A>,
who lent me his Mustek VDC-200).
<P>First of all: a disclaimer. Basically, all this worked for me. If it
doesn't work for you, burns down your house/car/household pet, that's your
problem. People building PSUs, it's a good idea to test them (voltage,
current, etc) under load (eg: a partially dead hard disk) before plugging
in an expensive PC motherboard which it may well blow up.
<p>For those of you looking for a complete, built, in-dash player should look
at my <b>empeg</b> unit (<a href="http://www.empeg.com">http://www.empeg.com</a>
which is very cute ;)

<H2>
<A NAME="Why"></A>Why?</H2>
The whole idea got rolling when I decided I wanted to upgrade my car stereo
in my <A HREF="http://www.cryton.demon.co.uk/mx5">Mazda MX5</A> (Miata
to Americans, Eunos Roadster for Japanese!). Up until MP3mobile, I'd been
using a Sony TCD-D3 DAT walkman on a car-mount arm as the primary audio
source, which was great: long play, good quality audio - just that I never
seemed to have the tapes with me that suited my mood, and the D3 doesn't
have useful things like track programming or repeat. While looking at new
head units/autochangers, two thoughts struck me:
<UL>
<LI>
6 or 10 CDs isn't a very big choice - even blowing your own CDRs with your
favourite music, it still means that you have a pretty limited selection,
and the slow disc change doesn't help when you're flitting around tunes
trying to find what you want.</LI>

<LI>
The boot in the MX5 is small enough already without an autochanger box
taking up room.</LI>

<LI>
The price of a new head unit and autochanger is awfully close to a complete
PC.</LI>
</UL>
So, I built an in-car MP3 player. The result isn't minature, like the MPman,
but does take no 'user-accessible' space in the car interior, and is pretty
secure. Possible future commercial versions will most likely be the same
form factor as a normal radio/cassette. The rest of this page goes into
mind-numbing detail about how it was built and things to look out for if
you try this yourself - but the basic concept is simple: a wide range of
great quality music (all of which I like, unlike compilations) whenever
I want it.
<P>The final result is immensely wonderful, and impresses the hell out
of most hackerish people (like me). Non-computer people just wonder why
you havn't got a CD player. But, with my setup (based on RedHat Linux 5.0)
I can do these things:
<UL>
<LI>
NFS mount my car from my laptop (there's a loose 10-base-T cable behind
the drivers seat) and squirt new tunes into it.</LI>

<LI>
Hook up my GSM-modem to the car (so you can telnet into it and run emacs
at 60mph :-) ).</LI>

<LI>
Hook up a GPS unit, so you could finger the car and find out exactly where
a car full of computer equipment suitable for stealing is located.</LI>

<LI>
Compile as I go round bends.</LI>

<LI>
Coredump as I change gear :-)</LI>
</UL>
None of these things can be done with an autochanger. Sorry, but you lose
:-)
<P>Future plans include:
<UL>
<LI>
418Mhz low-power radio link to allow me to upgrade the software when the
car is in the garage 30m or so from the flat.</LI>

<LI>
Link into the car's engine management to monitor boost pressure, etc</LI>

<LI>
Voice-command of the music functions.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
<A NAME="How"></A>How it looks</H2>
Here are some pictures of the system's display: mounted just below the
stock radio/cassette unit, it's very unobtrusive. The lefthand part of
the display usually scrolls the title/artist information, with the right
hand side showing elapsed time. The sexy spun-aluminium gearknob is a Voodoo
knob (see <A HREF="http://www.miata.net">miata.net</A>'s marketplace section).
You can also see the audio output from the MP3 player going into the CD-in
jack on the front of the radio.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="greenday.jpg" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320><IMG SRC="radiohead.jpg" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>

<P>...and yes, I own all the CDs that the music on the system has been
compressed from. Below you see the ridiculous looking exclaimation mark
on the VFD display :-)

enter (via the ID3 year tag). Very 'golden year', isn't it?

<A NAME="Techie"></A>The Techie Details</H2>
(abandon hope here if you're not technical)
<H3>
Where?</H3>
I'd seen some articles on fitting rear-deck speakers into MX5's, which
noted that there was room either side of the fuel tank on the rear shelf
to fit some extra speakers - so, I opened up the rear deck (lots and lots
of bolts, carpet, clips...) and found two ducts that go from just behind
the front seats into the boot which are about 16cm wide by 9 tall by 50
or so deep - ideal :-) The larger one of these ducts (the one which doesn't
lead to the spare tyre mountings) is where the MP3mobile is situated.
<H3>
The Processor &amp; hard drive</H3>
Now all I needed was a computer. Ideally, I wanted to use an ARM-based
machine, because I like them - unfortunately, there wasn't anything easily
off-the-shelf that was usable, so I decided to look for small PCs. After
a couple of months of keeping an eye out for a suitable broken laptop (486dx100+,
dead screen, dead keyboard, onboard sound...) I gave up and started looking
for embedded industrial control computers.
<P>Quite soon, I found the <A HREF="http://www.advantech.com.tw">Advantech</A>
PCM-5862 'biscuit PC'. This board puts an entire Pentium PC (including:
2 72-pin SIMM sockets, Socket7 (to 200Mhz), 10-base-T Ethernet, 16-bit
audio, 2xUSB, EIDE, Floppy, 4xSerial, Parallel, PCI slot, PC/104 slot,
SVGA with monitor and LCD drive) into the footprint of a 5.25" disk drive
- and best of all, runs from a single +5v supply. I found an importer,
found out the price (urk, not cheap - I paid 293+VAT from <A HREF="http://www.ucs.co.uk">UCS</A>
in the UK), screamed a bit, then bought it anyway: it's still cheaper than
an autochanger...
<P>Next was a CPU - I didn't need anything powerful, and ended up with
a secondhand Cyrix P150: this is actually fairly marginal for mp3 decoding
- I'd underestimated how bad the FPU is in those things when compared to
a genuine Intel. It soon got replaced by a P166MMX (see below).
<P>The hard disk I chose was a <A HREF="http://www.hitachi.com">Hitachi</A>
2.1Gb 2.5" laptop drive - after much umming and aaahing, I decided to go
for a 2.5" even though the capacity was way down on what I could get for
the same price in 3.5". Basically, the Hitachi drive could withstand operating
shock of 100G (300G non-operating), and ran off a teensy little 0.5A at
+5v. The Adavantech board's EIDE is on a 2.5" drive connector anyway, so
attaching it was no problem. I had thought of using a small HDD and a 5-CD
EIDE changer, but the fact that most CD-ROMs nowadays are incredibly plasticky
put me off somewhat.
<H3>
Power Supply</H3>
With the whole system together, I needed to power it: my power supply design
expertise doesn't extend very far at all, but even I knew that using 7805's
to drop +12-16v down to 5v at up to 5A was going to generate a LOT of heat,
so I searched the web for a suitable switch-mode PSU chip - the <A HREF="http://www.st.com">SGS-Thompson</A>
L4970A is rated at 10A, and the datasheet includes some helpful example
circuits (hint: I'm using the one entitiled 'Low cost 5.1v 10A power supply'
in the .pdf :-) ). This chip, and all the bits for the PSU can be bought
from <A HREF="http://www.farnell.co.uk">Farnell</A>, who have distributors
almost anywhere and will deal with individuals (as long as you've got Access
or VISA). One thing that was harder to get off the shelf was the 40uH 10A
inductor, so I used two of the Newport 11A 22uH ones that Farnell do stock,
in series. I should say at this point that <A HREF="http://www.reality.demon.co.uk">Patrick</A>,
a mad inventor friend who's much better at breadboarding than me, actually
built the circuit!
<P>As the Advantech manual notes, if you give it a +12v supply to the board,
you get higher quality audio (it isolates the analogue audio bits from
the switching noise of the logic circuitry), so I put on a SGS-Thompson
L4940V12 (Farnell code 413-197), 12v low-drop-out (LDO) regulator, to give
me a maximum of 1.5A at 12v - might be useful if I ever fit a CD-ROM...
<P>If you're building the PSU: please note that everything needs to be
bolted to a heatsink - this means the 4970, the 4940 and the 1545 Schottky
diode used in the 4970 circuit. However, the heatsink tag on the 1545 is
<B>NOT
GROUND</B> and needs an insulator so that it isn't connected to case ground
otherwise things will go bang - these are easily available from electronics
suppliers. I suggest you check it with a multimeter before powering it
up!
<P><B>UPDATE! I've just (4th September 1998) replaced the 5v PSU with a
better part. See the news section for details.</B>
<P>For input power, I used a Neutrik speaker connector (Speakon) which
will pass an ungodly amount of amps, and as a side-effect both looks cool
and has the most addictive push-and-twist to lock docking motion of any
connector I've ever used :-)&nbsp; It's also got 4 poles, which is useful
for the ignition sense (see below).
<H3>
Casing it</H3>
Finding a box that was the right size wasn't easy... I needed something
metal, so that it could be used as a heatsink (the power supply especially
needed the chips bolting to something metal to remove the heat). In the
end I used two preformed aluminium boxes, one which held the PC and hard
drive, and the other which held the PSU - both were from <A HREF="http://www.maplin.co.uk">Maplin</A>
Electronics. Here, the help of Franc Buxton (a technician/car nut who works
at The Department of Computer Science, Warwick University) came in handy,
as did the department's fully equipped workshop, full of things like punches,
drills, rivet guns and so on. Franc basically did all the drilling, cutting,
punching, crimping, rivetting and that sort of stuff to leave me with two
boxes attached together, lots of cooling vents, fans, phono connectors
and 25-way D's on the ends of the box. There are vents above the Pentium
on the Advantech board to allow it to breathe in, and another fan (off
a Pentium heatsink, which incidentally is the cheapest/only way to get
50mm fans) which blows air past the PSU and then through the CPU box, leaving
at vents towards the front of the car.
<P>The hard disk is mounted hanging from the lid of the computer's box
in a small cradle, slightly shock mounted on little rubber gromits, and
mounted the right way up (it'd have been a lot easier to put it upsidedown,
but I was a bit nervous about that!).
<P>Some pictures of inside/outside of the unit <A HREF="inside.htm">can
be found here</A>.
<H3>
Power Control &amp; input</H3>
After trying the PSU out on the bench, a couple of things became aparent:
<UL>
<LI>
It used shedloads of power and got very hot.</LI>

<LI>
If the input voltage went below 12v, the 5v line sagged down to about 4v,
meaning bye bye PC operation.</LI>
</UL>
This needed a two-prong attack. One, reduce power consumption - it was
taking about 5A at 5v, and despite the PSUs ratings, I had doubts about
it, as it seemed to be cutting out every 30 seconds or so - maybe my inductors
weren't up to the job, and quite possibly as the example circuit was designed
for 35v input, something wasn't operating at optimum efficiency. After
trying downclocking the CPU (to 50Mhz, x2, ie 100Mhz as opposed to the
normal Cyrix 60Mhz, x2) which saved about 0.5A, I tried fitting the P166-MMX
from my desktop machine: this has a 2.8v core (as opposed to the Cyrix's
3.3v), and when underclocked to 125Mhz (50Mhz, x2.5) the whole system took
just over 3A - much better, and the PSU wasn't trying to burn the house
down now, either. I ended up buying a new AMD K6-233 for my desktop and
using the P166MMX in the car! <B>UPDATE</B>: the P166 decided (after 2
weeks) that it didn't like running at 125Mhz anymore, and is now back at
166Mhz. The PSU is coping...
<P>The other problem was that car batteries are usually about 12v, but
can be below this with the engine off (with it on, they're usually about
14v) - this wasn't really a problem, as I didn't plan to listen to music
with the engine off much, anyway. The problem was to ensure the machine
got powered off reliably, and after it was shut down properly (it runs
RedHat Linux 5.0) - so, a PIC16LC84 was bought and I breadboarded a little
power control circuit.
<P>Basically, this circuit does two things:
<UL>
<LI>
It scans the keypad matrix, a standard 12-key telephone item from Farnell
on a long lead (so it could be used then dropped on the floor), and converted
this to serial data to be fed into the Linux box via COM1:. The keypad
is totally passive, with a keypress just joining together the appropriate
row and column lines on the keypad connector.</LI>

<LI>
It monitors the state of the ignition, and controls the power to the main
switch-mode PSU, using a VN05 high-side driver. This chip will switch up
to 12A and can be driven from a a logic level output (eg: direct from a
PIC). It's protected against everything, from over current to over heating,
and doesn't cost and arm and a leg either.</LI>
</UL>
Since this circuit would be powered up <I>all</I> the time (it's directly
wired into the battery), I wanted a low-power solution - ok, so the 16LC84
was probably overkill (a 16C84 isn't exactly high-drain!), and a small
100ma 7805 provides a regulated 5v to power the PIC and the MAX232 which
gives RS232 drive levels for talking to COM1 on the PC. A dropping resistor
and a 5.1v Zener diode bring the ignition sense line down into the realm
of a signal that you can shove into a PIC, and the keypad scan routine
was helpfully provided as an example that came on the install disk of the
PIC C compiler used.
<P>When you get into the car and want music, you just hit any key on the
keypad: if the ignition is on, it powers up the PC, and then sends any
keypresses to COM1 as ASCII (0-9, * &amp; #). If the PC is on and the car
engine is switched off, the PIC notices this, and sends '!' to the PC on
COM1 every second for 30 seconds, then turns off the PC power supply: the
PC takes about 15-20 seconds to complete a /sbin/halt, so that works out
nicely. <b>Update!</b> someone built this circuit, progammed my code, then
couldn't get it working... I forgot to mention that now you have to type
"123" in sequence to start the main computer - I changed this from any key to
prevent accidental powerups.
<P>The PIC binary (in intel hex format) is <A HREF="car.hex">here</A>:
remember to set the correct options before programming the pic - I use
an XT oscillator, watchdog timer off, boot timer on. I've not included
the source as some of it was from the PIC C compiler examples which are
copyright (and also, this requires you to have the PIC C compiler!). The
pinout is as follows:
<P>A0, serial tx (to pc, via MAX232)
<BR>A1, serial rx (from pc, via MAX232 - not used as yet)
<BR>A2, ignition sense (high=on, take ignition line through a 10k resistor
to this pin, with a 5.1v Zener pointing UP from ground to this pin to limit
the voltage)
<BR>A3, pc power control (high=on, this goes directly to the high-side
driver)
<BR>A4, pc reset (low=reset, this generates a small reset pulse a second
after powering the PC on: it's not actually used as the Advantech resets
OK).
<BR>B0, keypad column 1 (Pulled to 5v via a 10k resistor)
<BR>B1, keypad column 2 (Pulled to 5v via a 10k resistor)

<H3>
The display</H3>
I needed something pretty to go into the dashboard and tell me what was
playing (and allow me to select things) - the head unit I've got is the
original Clarion CRH60, which is just a radio-cassette, but has a good
amp and is completely removable (essential for a convertible) - so there
was no CD-autochanger interface to even try to reverse-engineer. Ideally,
a small TFT display would have been nice, but they're a little expensive
(like way more than the computer and hard disk put together...). Instead,
when I was round at Patrick's workshop, he gave me a 16-character vacuum-flourescent
starburst display (identical to the ones in fruit machines) - Farnell sell
these: two versions - small (like mine, 9mm characters), code 481-671,
or large (12.5mm characters) code 942-420. They're driven with a 2 wire
interface (plus reset), and have onboard PSUs which generate the 50v for
display drive, and so only need +5v to run: they're also pretty bright,
and so can be seen in a car in daylight.
<P>The display was hooked up to the low 3 bits of the PC's parallel port
and I worked out the command set (having drawn a blank on finding programming
data on the OKI 1937 VFD driver on internet) - the display can be dimmed
and you can set the cursor position, basically. There are some other bits
I havn't worked out which seem to give super-bright, but I can't repeat
the results reliably! I had thought of using a PIC to drive the display
from a standard COM port, but the protocol is so simple and with only 16
characters to refresh a 'hit the hardware' approach doesn't munch too much
Linux CPU time.
<P>Both the display and keypad come out on a single 25-way D type, allowing
me to unplug everything easily when I want to take the PC inside: soon,
I won't be able to do this, as I'll have bolted down the plate which covers
the access to the duct - but I'm not doing this until I'm sure I can deal
with it not fsck'ing properly without removing the machine!
<H3>
Audio output</H3>
During tests indoors, the audio output of the Advantech board was excellent,
probably better than my AWE64 home PC: out in the car though, there was
a LOT of ignition noise on the sound, probably due to ground loops (so
people who know tell me, that's a concept a bit too analogue for me!).
An in-phono-line audio supressor (isloates everything from everything else)
from Maplin fixed this amazingly well, but did cost 15 pounds - there's
probably something I could have done with capacitors that would have had
the same effect, but that'd be too tricky for me...
<P>The audio comes out on two poncy gold-plated (99p each) phonos on the
outside of the case.
<H2>
<A NAME="Software"></A>Software</H2>
I wanted something which would play mp3 tunes without complaining, and
with an easy-to-use interface for another program (ie my keypad/display
handlers) to talk to. After playing with the jukebox interfaces of mpg123,
I tried <A HREF="http://www.xaudio.com">Xaudio</A>, which worked like a
dream (I use the 'rxaudio' program, which in the current release doesn't
talk well down pipes, but this can be fixed by talking to it with pty's:
in fact, this bug has been fixed with version 1.00, so it's now perfect
:-) ). One of the other things I liked about Xaudio was the provision of
second-by-second elapsed time, which meant that the time indicator on the
display was a doddle to implement - the jukebox interfaces of some other
players didn't have this info easily accessible.
<P>Currently, the software's pretty basic. On boot, it loads a pre-compiled
ID3 database (this can be rebuilt using *8). I can then select tunes by
year, random play, play group, artist, and so on, using a simple back/forward/select
mechanism from the keypad (unfortunately, the keypad doesn't have the ABC,
DEF, and so on printed on the keys like a phone, which would have helped
a lot...). I can mute the tune with #, pause, restart, skip forward and
back and so on - it's great!
<P>The display by default shows the artist &amp; title (scrolling in a
12 character field), one space, and then M.SS (the dot takes no space,
as it gets turned on in the M segment's display) - * goes into command
mode, allowing you to pick functions 0-9 (or * to return to play mode).
*1 is artist select, *2 is year select, *8 does a rescan of the filesystem/rebuild
of the ID3 database, and *9 will do a shutdown if you need to shutdown
without turning the ignition off. At any point I can key 9 to build a random
playlist: eg: *19 builds a random playlist of everything in the database,
*1 (then select an artist) #9 gives me random play of tunes from that artist,
and so on.
<P>People have asked for source for various bits of the system: below are
some snippets that should help people doing the same sort of things. Please
note that this is quick-hack code, so don't expect prettyness/whatever.
It just works. Also, please don't mail me if you have no idea how to do
anything with these files: I've not got time to teach people programming,
these are just bits to point people in the right direction (or at least
a direction).

I'm currently working on an in-dash commercial version of the mp3mobile:
more info on this can be found on the <a href="http://www.empeg.com">empeg</a>
website. Basically this unit will fit in a standard dash-mount slot, and provide
RCA outs for external head units or amps.
Pricing will be comparable to high-end cd autochangers/head units, and
we hope to have prototypes out for testing in the next few months.

<p><br><b>PaulB's CAJUN audio jukebox</b>
<p>Paul's just mailed me about his jukebox project, which uses more
off-the-shelf PC bits (for those without too much soldering ambition) but
has a bigger display, an onboard radio, and it looks really neat. Of course,
he runs Linux too :-)

<P><BR><B>General updates</B><B></B>
<P>I've gone through the page and added Farnell order codes for parts as
appropriate. Farnell trade almost everywhere and you can get pricings in
your local currency from <A HREF="http://www.farnell.com">www.farnell.com</A><B></B>
<P><B>New power supply</B>
<P>The original 5v PSU documented above wasn't going too well. At times
(for example, after a long journey (when the PSU was hot) and the headlights
and fan were on) I'd get dropouts in the music: the display kept scrolling,
but the music stopped. This turned out to be the 5v rail drooping enough
to cause the HDD to spin-down, although the PC was unaffected (remembering
that the CPU runs on 2.9v, a droop in the +5v rail doesn't affect it too
much).
<P>So, I upgraded the PSU. As now (unlike when I started the project) I
knew that 5A at 5v was sufficient, I tracked down a different switch-mode
PSU chip, the <A HREF="http://www.maxim-ic.com">Maxim</A> MAX787 (Farnell
order code 787-530). Again, using the example circuit in the datasheet
(see Maxim's website &amp; download the .pdf), this was built up and worked
perfectly. Unlike the L4970A, the MAX787 is fine down to input voltages
of 8v, which means that the battery would have to be completely dead for
the computer not to work correctly - and also, it needs almost no external
components: big electrolytics on the input and output, a timing capacitor
and resistor, the inductor (50uH this time - I used a 47uH - Farnell code
482-572) and a MBR745 (Farnell code 364-230). Note that like the 1545 in
the old PSU, the heatsink mounting point on this diode is NOT GROUND and
will need a mica spacer and other bits to insulate it - although the MAX787
is short-circuit protected, so if it shorts you won't blow anything up,
you'll just get no +5v rail.
<P>This setup runs <I>much</I> cooler - on the old one, the heat from the
4970 was major, even after only 30 seconds, whereas the 787 runs warm as
opposed to hot. You'll still need a heatsink, though. I rescued the old
L4940V12 (Farnell code 413-197) from the old PSU and reused it, as I'd
had no problems with this.
<P>One other thing: my system takes less than 5A. If you use a higher voltage
processor (eg: non-MMX pentium, Cyrix, etc) then you'll probably need a
heftier supply, or possibly two of these in parallel. The MAX787 has a
current limiter set at 6.5A, so you shouldn't fry anything by mistake,
but be careful. Remember there will be a current peak when turning the
think on (eg: Inrush and HDD spinup) so it's only the "operational" current
you have to get worried about.
<P><B>TV appearance</B>
<P>Yes, the mp3mobile is going to be on TV! Yesterday, Dave Green from
the '404 not found' programme on <A HREF="http://www.tvchannel.co.uk">[.tv]</A>,
Sky's new computer channel, came round and filmed me, the car, and the
mp3mobile. Hopefully, it should be on in a couple of weeks - I'll give
more info when I have it - 404 not found is shown on Tuesday nights at
7pm UK-time. Tuning information: Astra 1D satellite, 10.847GHz, Vertical
polarisation. [.tv] only broadcast from 6pm, so before that you get some
Granada channel...
<P>No idea on encryption and that sort of stuff, it might be in the clear:
would someone from Europe tell me if [.tv] is encrypted? I know it's part
of the free Sky package, but I don't know if that means it's encrypted
or not...
<P><B>Commercial version update</B>
<P>Things are going well: we've got the PCBs for the production prototype
back about a week ago, and Patrick surface-mounted everything by hand (brave
man...) and it worked! It's a totally sexy 6-layer PCB, measuring only
6"x5", and can support up to 16Gb of disk :-). I'm currently working on
the low-level firmware for the unit, then Linux will be fiddled with and
plonked onto it. More news, a mailing to the announcement list, and www.empeg.com's
opening will come shortly!

<P><BR><B>Commercial version &amp; other bits</B>
<P>The commercial version is going nicely, with the first production prototype
PCB about to be sent off to the PCB-producers. Some of the highlights:
same size as a euro car stereo (Blaupunkt, Pioneer, etc), graphic display,
IR remote, IrDA on the front panel for Palmpilot (etc) interface, USB,
RDS/RBDS FM tuner, high-speed serial for those without USB... and more.
Still runs linux, too :-)
<P>When we've got it in its box, www.empeg.com will go up with pictures
and so on, and there will be a mailing to the annoucement list.
<P>Completely separately, someone has mailed me who hasn't had time to
complete their own MP3mobile project and wants to sell their bits:

New domain!</H4>
In preparation for the commercial site I've just got a catchy new domain...
there's nothing there (yet) but it's where the info on the commercial version
will go, and where mailing list stuff will come from. It's www.empeg.com,
which is very cheesy but quite cool (IMHO) :-)

Mobile rc5 cracking :-)</H4>
I've finally got round to putting rc5-64 on the mp3mobile, so in the free
CPU time (about 50%, now the CPU is clocked at 166Mhz) my car is trying
to crack some RSA encryption. I wonder how many keys/gallon it gets? I
have to move the keyfiles around on the laptop at the moment, but when
I get round to wiring the mobile phone up it'll be much easier to do key
dumps...
<P>For those of you who want to help, I'm in the rc5@ant.org (Team 553)
team, so join it &amp; help us! Distributed.net are (unsuprisingly) at
<A HREF="http://www.distributed.net">www.distributed.net</A>.
<H4>
Software updates</H4>
I've been tweaking slightly, and now have added code so that in random
play mode, if (say) you hear an Oasis tune, and want another one, hitting
8 during play resorts the rest of the playlist so that there's a tune by
the same artist played next. Good for mood continuation :-)

Paris (1st-4th May, 1998)</H4>
The Paris trip was brilliant (thankyou Ronald!) only marred by the fact
that the mp3mobile packed up when we arrived at the hotel, meaning that
the UK people has seen it in action on the trip down, but noone else :-(
<P>The problem was traced to the board deciding it was now not interested
in running at anything below 166Mhz: when in Paris I tried running it <I>slower</I>
(incase it was a PSU fault and reducing the current might help) but didn't
think of running it <I>faster</I>! (and it worked fine from then...). Since
then, someone who looked at the Intel datasheets said that the MMX chips
don't like running at &lt;166Mhz, as no slower variants were every made.
Hmm. Strange it didn't even work at 150Mhz, but there you go...
<P><B>Source and stuff</B>
<P>I've put up some bits of UNIX source and the PIC object code, and updated
some bits on the PSU page.
