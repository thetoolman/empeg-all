Pictures of the embedded MP3 player's hardware&nbsp;

First, the actual unit: it's long and thin, as the space it fits into is
also long and thin! The lower bit is the actual computer box, which houses
the embedded PC, hard disk, and I/O connectors. The louvres at the front
are for the cooling air to exit: the ones in the top are directly above
the CPU fan. The air blows from the back of the unit (where a 50mm Pentium
heatsink fan is mounted), past the PSU and through a hole into the main
computer case. The connector to the right of the fan is the Neutrik Speakon
socket, where the power goes in. Also at the front is the 25-way D connector,
which houses keypad scan, display drive &amp; power, COM2 serial I/O (for
the mobile phone) and 10-base-T ethernet: below this are the two phono
sockets for audio out. To remove the unit from the car, I just have to
remove the 25-way D, the audio and the power - much neater than connections
for everything individually.

<P>Next, some pictures of the inside of the case. The wiring isn't very
neat (a slight understatement...) but the extra power wire lets me hook
it up to a real PSU indoors if required. The ribbon cable is all over the
place as the SBC uses IDC plugs for practically all its I/O (serial, video,
audio, parallel...) - the audio stuff gets straight into sheilded cable
within a few millimeters though, in an effort to preserve audio quality.

<P>The inside of the PSU part: on the left is the PIC16LC84 board, with
ribbon cable going off to the other end of the case where it goes into
the 25-way D connector (which connects to the keypad) and to COM1. The
component bolted to the case is the VN05 solid-state switch. The board
on the right is the switch-mode PSU, and the gunk it's all covered in is
hot melt glue to help prevent components from wobbling about and breaking
tracks. As you can see, the ait blows in from the fan, over the PSU and
through the hole by the PIC board into the main box.

<P>The hard disk is mounted in a little U-shaped bracket hanging from the
lid of the box. As you can see, the disk is semi-shock mounted using gromits
in the holes in the cradle, between the cradle and the hard disk, and between
the cradle and the plastic screw-head.The white bit is some fanfold paper
pretending to be a gromit, because I lost one!
