            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this next set of tests, we'll be 
            verifying that all of your speakers are &quot;in-phase&quot; with one another.&nbsp; 
            Essentially, when two speakers are out of phase with one another, 
            one speaker is pushing while the other speaker is pulling.&nbsp; 
            This problem is actually quite common in some home and car audio setups 
            because it is caused by the simple mistake of having one speaker's 
            negative and positive connections switched..&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For a graphic representation, the following diagram shows two 
            sounds waves that are 180 degrees out of phase from another:</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/outofphase.gif" width="181" height="289"></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because these sound waves represent 
            pure tones, playing both waves at the same time would cause them to 
            completely cancel each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; When playing music, having 
            an out of phase speaker can cause a distorted stereo image as well 
            as cancellation at some frequencies.&nbsp; Luckily, checking for 
            this condition and fixing it are very easy to do.&nbsp; To learn

            <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Phase Test Procedure<br>
            </b>There are plenty of guides on the internet that suggest hooking 
            up a small battery to your speaker wires to perform this test.&nbsp; 
            That procedure can damage your speakers and requires two people to 
            do it safely.&nbsp; Instead, we're going to use a simple test track.</font><p>
            <font face="Arial" size="2">1. Download
            <a href="soundfiles/speakerpolaritycheck.mp3">speakerpolaritycheck.mp3</a> (Right-click, Save As..) and load the 
            file onto your empeg in a new playlist called <i>&quot;empeg sound - 
            Misc. Files.&quot;</i>&nbsp; 
            Select this playlist and mark it &quot;<a href="../../images/ignoreaschild.gif">Ignore 
            as Child</a>&quot; so that it won't get played during normal player use.</font></p>
            <p>
            <font face="Arial" size="2">2. Synchronize with your 
            player and go find your car.</font></p>
            <p>
            <font face="Arial" size="2">3.&nbsp; <i>(Recommended: Drive your car to 
            a quiet location.)</i>&nbsp; Insert your empeg&nbsp;into your car's sled and apply power.&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4.&nbsp; Using the rotary encoder 
            (volume knob), adjust the Fader Control all the way to the <b>Front</b>.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">5.&nbsp; Using the rotary controller, 
            access the player's Sound menu and apply the following settings:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Set  Balance to its

            <a href="http://empeg-hijack.sourceforge.net/">Hijack</a> menu by 
            pressing and holding the rotary controller to apply the following 
            settings: <i>(If you do not have HiJack installed, you can skip this 
            step).</i></font></p>
            <ul>

              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Set Auto Volume Adjust to &quot;Off&quot;.</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7.&nbsp; Select your &quot;Test Tones&quot; playlist that includes the track you downloaded in Step #1 and begin 
            playback.&nbsp;&nbsp; The track will walk you through the test 
            procedure.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8.&nbsp; If you need to make any 
            adjustments to your speaker wires, turn off the player and set the 
            car's ignition to the &quot;off&quot; position.&nbsp; Now you can safely check 
            the speaker connections on your amp to fix the problem.&nbsp; Repeat 
            Step #6 to verify you've fixed the problem.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">9.&nbsp; Once the front speakers are 
            in phase, adjust the Fader Control all the way to the <b>Rear</b> 
            and repeat Steps 6 &amp; 7 for the rear speakers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Optional:</b>&nbsp; Sometimes, 
            when speakers are not mounted close to each other (i.e., component 
            speakers that have the midrange drivers on the 
            doors and tweeters up in the dash), reversing the polarity on 
            tweeters or mids makes the system sound better because it makes up 
            for phase differences due to distance. &nbsp; Try different combinations 
            and see what sounds better.<br>
