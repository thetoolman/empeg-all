<title>vfdlib - a graphics library for the RioCar/Empeg</title>

<h1>vfdlib</h1>

<p>I have developed a graphics library for the RioCar/Empeg. The product itself has been discontinued, but interest in developing new applications is very high for the people lucky enough to own one.

<p>In my attempts at writing software for the RioCar I found that the biggest initial stumbling block is getting graphics onto the display. There is no API as such for developers to build their applications with so they are forced to either start from scratch or seek out other solutions.

<p>We already have the excellent <a href="http://empeg-hijack.sourceforge.net/">hijack</a> kernel as a means of launching applications on top of the player software. I believe that vfdlib in conjuction with hijack will lead to some very nifty apps appearing on the RioCar.

<p>My library is written in C and is covered by the GNU GPL license. It is fully documented, compact and well optimised. It includes the ability to draw lines, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, bitmaps and text.

<h1>empacman</h1>

<p>Empacman is an arcade game for your RioCar/Empeg. My plan is to release some of my own apps that I have developed, as examples for other people to follow and improve upon. This is the first. [Archived <a href="../sourceforge.net/projects/empeg-vfdlib/files/empacman/">here</a>]
