<h1 align=middle>Empeg Docking Station</h1>
Here is production unit #001 of the Empeg Docking Station (photographs below).
This specific unit was given away as a raffle prize at the 2003 Empeg Meet in Amersfoort.
<p>
This is a standalone Empeg/RioCar enclosure, with integrated docking for audio and ethernet.  It can be used as-is, or as a <em>smart sled</em> for integration into a larger component box.  The small size of the basic unit here makes it easy to fit onto a desktop at work or in the home office.
<p>
A considerable amount of effort has gone into the design of the dock to keep it simple yet elegant, and to incorporate the features most important for a home/office resting place for this amazing audio player.

These are constructed from unfinished MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard), sanded smooth, and are ready for the paint color(s) of your choosing/doing.  There is a round opening on each side to allow cool air into the side vents of the player, and the two openings also double as convenient lift points for securely carrying the enclosure around.

On the back panel, you can see the 10BaseT ethernet jack, the serial port, 12VDC power jack, and R/L audio outputs. The three larger holes are for airflow (cooling).  Your original equipment Empeg/RioCar AC-adaptor is used as the power source.

Internally, there are integrated docking and ethernet connectors, as well as a pair of Formica skids for the player to slide in and out on.  The bottom of the dock can be unscrewed from below, giving full access to the internals for maintenance or modifications.
<p>
Two side vents allow fresh air to be drawn inside the player, and a concealed air channel in the top directs warm air from the player to the rear and out through an integrated exhaust fan (except "Basic" models).  The fan operates only when the player is active.  The popular Hijack enhancement kernel automatically distinguishes between "docked" and "in-car" operating modes (normally the player would think it was "in-car" when powered from a dock).
<p>
A metal docking sled is <b>not</b> used in this design, reducing the cost substantially.  
This dock is designed to cost less than a bare sled on it's own, and look much nicer to boot!

There are 75 individual pieces that go into the construction
of each "Works" docking station,
most of which are shown in the photograph above.  Missing from the photo are the
two screws for securing the docking connector, the two screws for attaching the fan,
and the crimp pin for the +12V fan connection.
The network cable is custom-made from three pieces,
and the four (felt or rubber) feet count as a single piece since they remain stuck together
for the dock owner to install after painting.
<p>
Production is limited, typically just a few units per week.

Cheers!
