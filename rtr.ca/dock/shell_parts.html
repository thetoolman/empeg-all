<h2>Parts Needed To Complete Wiring of a "Shell" Dock.</h2>
The "shells" being distributed in May 2005 are unwired bare MDF shells
only, and extra parts are needed to complete the dock for use.

<pre>

 -- Two #4 x 1/2" round head metalwork screws for the docking connector.

 -- Two #4 x 3/4" round head metalwork screws for the fan.

 -- Two #6 x 1/2" flat head wood screws for for underside of the lid.

 -- 10" to 12" long straight-through ethernet patch cable.
    Crimp it yourself or find one in stock somewhere.

 -- DC-Power jack, panel-mount.  I use Circuit-Test #360-021-10,
    and have been unable to find an equivalent at DigiKey.
    But Radio-Shack commonly stocks these, so just take the
    AC-Adaptor there, and find a mate for it.

 -- RCA Left (white/black) and Right (red) jacks for audio-out.
    These can be bought at *any* electronics shop, or ordered from
    DigiKey (CP-1412-ND, CP-1413-ND).

 -- Docking Connector:  order from DigiKey (H10109-ND).

 -- Signal Pins for Docking Connector:  twenty-two (22) in total,
    but a Works dock uses only nine of them.  The extras are useful
    for AUX-IN, MIC, and "learning curve" assembly issues.
    Order from DigiKey (H10087-ND).

 -- Power Pins for Docking Connector:  two (2) of these required,
    but order an extra one or two in case of trouble.
    Order from DigiKey (H10085-ND).

 -- Cooling FAN 40x40x10mm.  Order from DigiKey (259-1198-ND).

 -- Trim Pot (potentiometer) to adjust fan speed, 0-500 Ohms.
    Raid the scrap heap or order one from Digikey (U262R501B-ND).

 -- Serial port DB-9M solder-cup style, with mounting screws.
    This can be obtained from any electronics shop, including DigiKey.

 -- Hookup wire.  Raid your scrap heap and use whatever you find,
    or visit an electronics shop.  Really, anything will do
    (but stranded wire is better than solid or single-strand wire).

 -- RJ45 coupler (two RJ45 sockets connected back-to-back, wired for "data").
    Even Home Depot carries these!

 -- Four small felt "sticky" pads to act as "feet" for the dock.
    Any hardware store will stock these by the thousands.

<p>
There is a wiring diagram (with photos) for the docks <a href="wiring.html">here</a>.
The basic assembly method is as follows:
<p>
Remove the back panel from the dock, and  mount all of the connectors onto it,
into the holes provided for them.
<p>
Next, connect up all of the wires to those connectors, and crimp the pins
for the docking connector onto them as appropriate.
<p>
Install the fan into the dock with two screws, but do not fully tighten them
(the dock is a LOT noisier if these are tight -- leave them sloppy).
<p>
Connect the fan wires to the back panel and to a crimp pin for the docking connector.  Do <b>not</b> thread the fan wires through the fan opening -- they simply tuck
into the same slot as the ethernet cable (later on).
<p>
Install the back panel -- it just slides <b>very firmly</b> into place.  It may help to first push the ethernet coupler further towards the interior of the dock.
<p>
One by one, feed the docking wires through the opening and plug them
into the (unattached) docking connector.  Be patient.
<p>
Now screw the docking connector into place, but leave the screws just
ever so loose -- not fully tight.
