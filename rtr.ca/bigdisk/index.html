BigDisk Builder (and more!) for Empeg/RioCar Mk2/Mk2a players
</h2>
These files are safe for use on any Empeg/Rio Car Mk2/Mk2a players
with any size of hard drive(s) installed.
<br>Use of these files is <b>required</b> for correct operation with any drives larger than 128GB.
<p>
Never use a kernel older than Hijack v464 with such drives!!

<td>This is <b><u>not</u></b> a disk builder image.  Rather, it is a regular software <b>.upgrade</b> file
which will install all of the fancy features of the <b>builder_bigdisk_v21</b> (below) onto an existing
formatted empeg without destroying the tunes/playlists that are already there.  Use this if you
want to add Hijack, WebLite, rsync, hdparm, smartctl, empeg-remote, etc.. to an existing empeg without having to fuss
over finding/installing each of those (and more!).  By default it also installs the <b>v2.01</b> player software,
but this is easily switched to v3alpha11 if desired.  See the notes for <b>builder_bigdisk_v21</b> below.

<p>Originally released just in time for the <b><i>empeg 21st Anniversary Meet</i></b> in 2019.
This is a drive initializer for Mk2/Mka2 empeg/RioCar player on any size drive(s),
with Hijack v526 and LBA48 support.  This version uses a 4KB blocksize (for faster everything).
This all-in-one builder initializes one or two drives, and then installs v2.01 software (with Hijack)
onto the primary drive, along with empeg WebLite, rsync, hdparm, smartctl, set_empeg_max_fid,
fidsift.sh, and other goodies!
As a result, it takes much less than the usual effort to get a new drive fully set up and running.
<p><b>New:</b> Now also includes the <b>Android</b> <a href="https://github.com/suomi35/empeg-remote/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/">empeg-remote</a> app from git,
which can be found/installed to an Android phone/tablet from a web browser pointed at the empeg's IP address.
<p><b>This builder will unconditionally <u>destroy</u> any existing
data on any/all attached drives.  USE WITH CAUTION.</b>
<p>By default, the <b>v2.01</b> player software and libaries are installed and initialized for use.
But one can easily switch to <b>v3alpha11</b> if preferred, by connecting to the serial port,
hitting Control^C to get a shell prompt, and entering this command: <b>switch_to_v3alpha11</b>
<p>There is a similar command to switch back to <b>v2.01</b> software:  <b>switch_to_v2.01</b>
<p>Note that this builder image may be updated here <i>(same name)</i> with fixes/improvements over time.
<p>The rest of the builders below are here only for historical reasons or really weird situations.

<td>Earlier version.  Drive initializer for any size drive(s), with Hijack v524 and LBA48 support.
This version uses a 4KB blocksize and 4X fewer inodes than the _v3_ builder (below).
As a result, it is better suited for very large disks, and requires less memory
on the player itself at install/run time (including playback etc..).
<b>Note that this builder will unconditionally <u>destroy</u> any existing
data on any/all attached drives.  USE WITH CAUTION.</b>
