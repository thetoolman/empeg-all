Here is the alpha release of EmpTriv.  Please let me know how this works for you.  Source code is now
included.  The TAR file is huge because of the questions/ subdirectory which contains, well, the
questions.  You need to install EmpTriv on your music partition, or another partition that can handle
a lot of files.  Optionally, just delete some of the questions to make things smaller.
<br>
I haven't worked on EmpTriv in a while but I did just figure out how to change the scheduling policy so that it
isn't so slow.  EmpTriv is still on my plate, but the alarm clock and the lyrics project (not pictured yet) are
a little higher up on the list.
