    <p>My son has quite a lot of Lego, but he stopped playing with it. It turns out
that he gets frustrated when he can’t find a particular piece. So we started
exploring storage options.</p>

<h2 id="one-big-box">One Big Box</h2>

<p>When I was a kid – and I had way more Lego than he does – I just had it all
in a big box. I used to love the noise and feeling of swishing through the box
to find the piece I wanted. I remember deliberately looking for a piece other
than the one I wanted, hoping to “trick” the Lego box, and to catch the one I
really wanted out of the corner of my eye.</p>

<p>The “one big box” solution doesn’t work for him. Maybe he’s a bit younger than
I was; maybe he just has less patience.</p>

<p>Or maybe there were fewer individual types of brick in my day?</p>

<h2 id="takeaway-tubs">Takeaway Tubs</h2>

<p>We tried using takeaway tubs, but they’re a bit flimsy, don’t pack very well,
and they’re really easy to knock over and spill the bricks.</p>

<h2 id="sort-and-store">Sort and Store</h2>

<p>Lego offer some options (which I can’t find on their online store right now),
such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lego-Storage-Brick-8-Yellow/dp/B003NE5L9A">Storage
Brick</a>, the
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lego-40321232-Storage-Head-Large/dp/B003NE5L86">Storage
Head</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lego-Sort-Store-Cheeky-Face/dp/B007I0C5NA">Sort and
Store</a>.</p>

<p>These are relatively expensive, and don’t seem to be useful for categorising
the LEGO bricks. That is: there’s no way to separate the really small pieces.
The “Sort and Store” is a clever idea, but these are basically just
LEGO-branded buckets.</p>

<h2 id="chima-sorting-system">Chima Sorting System</h2>

<p>However, completely coincidentally, I found the <a href="http://www.aplaceforeverything.co.uk/home-storage/lego-storage-box-sorting-system-chima">LEGO Chima - Sorting System
Storage
Boxes</a>.
This is a set of 3 stackable boxes, about A3 footprint, of varying heights. It
comes with a single sorting tray, with individual compartments for the smaller
pieces of Lego. This sits in the top of any one of the other tubs.</p>

<p>It’s pretty good, and it’s sparked my son’s Lego habit again, but it’s not
perfect – again, it’s relatively expensive, and it only comes with a single
sorting tray.</p>

<h2 id="really-useful-boxes">Really Useful Boxes</h2>

<p>However, I might have found another solution.</p>

<p>At home, for my storage, I’ve been a long-term fan of Really Useful Boxes.
They’re sturdy, they’ve got lids, and they stack. I use them in my home office,
in the shed and in the attic.</p>

<p>I generally pick them up from B&amp;Q or Staples.</p>

<p>While visiting their website the other day to get dimensions (I’m considering a
large, flat box to go in the back of the car), I discovered that <strong>they also
offer <a href="http://www.reallyusefulproducts.co.uk/uk/html/traydetails.php">sorting
trays</a></strong>.</p>

<p>These stack inside the existing boxes, and you can 2-4 trays inside the
conveniently-sized 9L box. They’ve got a “hobby tray” with square compartments,
a “stationery tray” that looks like it’ll be useful for the longer pieces of
Lego, and a “sorting tray” which is taller and has larger compartments.</p>

<p>I’ve not ordered any yet – I’m waiting until pay day – but I think I might
have just found the solution for a 5-year-old boy (and his Dad) with a Lego
habit.</p>
