    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>There’s a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
naming things.” - Phil Karlton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to talk about caching, but I’m <em>not</em> going to talk about cache
invalidation. Instead, I’m going to talk about caching in the face of
concurrent queries.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about this right now, because I’m looking at one of <a href="http://electricimp.com">electric
imp’s</a> backend daemons; specifically, the one that
handles incoming device connections.</p>

<p>When this daemon restarts (after an upgrade, say), all of the imps that were
connected to it reconnect immediately. This reconnection is transparent to user
code, but it results in a “horde” of imps hitting the daemon in one go.</p>

<p>Now, obviously, we cache a lot of the database queries, but when the daemon has
recently restarted, these caches will be cold, and they’ll be getting hit by
the “horde”.</p>

<h2 id="threads-and-caches">Threads and Caches</h2>

<p>This particular backend daemon at Electric Imp is written in Erlang, but I’ll
use C# for my examples, since it’s more accessible.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that I’ve got the following C# code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var cache = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, int&gt;();
var value = cache.GetOrAdd(42, k =&gt; ExpensiveCalculation(k));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is perfectly safe when used from multiple threads, but there’s a problem
with the amount of work that’s done. Consider what happens if we call it like
this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const int THREAD_COUNT = 1000;
Task.WaitAll(
    Enumerable.Range(1, THREAD_COUNT)
              .Select(i =&gt;
                      Task.Factory.StartNew(
                        () =&gt; {
                            var value = cache.GetOrAdd(42, k =&gt; ExpensiveCalculation(k));
                            // do something with value.
                        })
              ).ToArray();
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is: we spawn 1000 threads, each of which queries the cache for the same
key.</p>

<p>What actually happens is that more than one thread gets to run. Each of the
running threads discovers that the cache doesn’t contain the key, and begins
the expensive calculation. This means that instead of happening once, our
expensive calculation happens <em>N</em> times.</p>

<p>In this case, <em>N</em> happens to be roughly 4, because that’s the number of logical
cores in my laptop. This could easily get much, much, worse if – instead of
performing some calculation – you were hitting a database, and you did it
asynchronously, returning those tasks to the pool until the results came back.</p>

<h2 id="i-know-lets-use-a-lock">I know, let’s use a lock</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Some programmers, confronted with a threading problem, think “I know, I’ll
use a lock”. Now… They… Have… A… Different… Problem…”
– Me, just now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if the problem is that we don’t want to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">ExpensiveCalculation</code> more
than once at a time, we can use a lock:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int LockedExpensiveCalculation(int value)
{
    lock(something)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
        return value * value;
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s gotta be better, right? Well, actually, no. This time, the threads race
eachother to grab the lock, meaning that, instead of <em>N</em> threads running the
function in parallel, they end up convoying on the lock, and they take it in
turns to run the function. This means extra delay on top of the unneeded work.</p>

<h2 id="but-the-locks-in-the-wrong-place">But the lock’s in the wrong place!</h2>

<p>Well, I’m stupid. The reason that the threads are convoying on the lock is
because we put it inside the cache miss handler. Let’s put it around the cache
query instead:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// ...
Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; {
    int value;
    lock(something)
    {
        value = cache.GetOrAdd(42, k =&gt; ExpensiveCalculation(k));
    }
});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Is that any better?</p>

<p>Well, for certain values of “better”, yes. We only run the expensive
calculation once, meaning less work. In this contrived example, there’s also
negligible delay over the naive case as well, because the other threads just
wait until the cache contains the required value.</p>

<p>Let’s contrive a slightly more complicated example.</p>

<h2 id="a-slightly-more-complicated-contrived-example">A slightly more complicated contrived example</h2>

<p>In this example, the threads aren’t all asking for the same value. Instead,
they’re asking for a mixture of values:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>value = cache.GetOrAdd(i % 8, k =&gt; ExpensiveCalculation(k));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the problem is that we end up blocking each thread, even if it’s not their
expensive calculation that they’re waiting for. Now, depending on the nature of
the calculation, this might make sense.</p>

<p>But, if we do have multiple cores (or a beefy database server), it makes sense
to let at least some of the threads execute in parallel.</p>

<h2 id="promises">Promises</h2>

<p>What we need for that are <strong>promises</strong> or <strong>futures</strong>. In .NET-land, these are
represented (more-or-less) by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;</code>
types.</p>

<p>Instead of caching the actual value, we cache a promise:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var cache = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, Task&lt;int&gt;&gt;();

var value = cache.GetOrAdd(i % 8, k =&gt; PromiseExpensiveCalculation(k));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Task&lt;int&gt; PromiseExpensiveCalculation(int k)
{
    var completion = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;int&gt;();
    Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; completion.SetResult(ExpensiveCalculation()));
    return completion.Task;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This immediately returns a promise to the calling threads, with one promise for
each value of the key. This prevents the calling threads from all calling
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ExpensiveCalculation</code> at once.</p>

<p>It also spawns another task to actually do the expensive calculation. When this
is completed, it will fulfill the promise, releasing the waiting threads.</p>

<p>We can then use the .NET task scheduling algorithm to ensure that there aren’t
too many threads calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">ExpensiveCalculation</code> at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Cough</em>. Yeah. About that. In order to get this to work, you’ll need to pass
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.Factory.StartNew()</code>, otherwise .NET
will prove remarkably reluctant to start the worker thread. Which means you’ll
make no progress.</p>

<p>That’s a documented thing, but you need to be aware of it.</p>

<h2 id="queue">Queue</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you could come up with an implementation where you have a pool
of worker threads, a dictionary of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Key -&gt; Value | Semaphore</code> (basically a
promise), and a queue of requests. It’s equivalent to the above, but you get
more control over what’s going on.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-asyncawait">What about async/await?</h2>

<p>Yeah, probably.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope that I’ve demonstrated that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Naive cache access patterns can result in more work being done than
necessary.</li>
  <li>Locking can result in excessive slowdowns, loss of concurrency, and – if
done wrong – can still result in unnecessary work being done.</li>
  <li>Promises (or some equivalent) are the right answer.</li>
</ol>
