    <p>The hosting outfit that I’ve been using for differentpla.net is cheap for a reason: they’re not very good.</p>

<p>At the end of February, I managed to hose my VPS host. This, fair enough, was my fault. Where I started to run into problems was when I asked my hosting company to restore a backup. The backup was corrupted. Ordinarily, this wouldn’t be a problem: I had a fairly recent backup stored locally, so once the box was restored to the point that I could log in, I just restored from that.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, though, freaky things started to happen: files all over the disk were getting cross-linked with each-other. The MySQL database that runs this website got replaced with an XML file from the Ruby documentation. Not good.</p>

<p>I asked the support department at my hosting company to run fsck. “Oh no,” they said, “we can’t do that; it’ll mean taking down the VPS host”. Great. So now I’m left with a website that limps along, keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else gets overwritten. However, I’ve got a day job and a young son, so I don’t have a lot of time to worry about it.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the value of the pound collapsed against the dollar, meaning that my hosting costs doubled. Suddenly, cheap isn’t so cheap anymore.</p>

<p>But the straw that broke the camel’s back is the fact that, for 5 out of the last 7 days, I’ve been unable to reach my VPS.</p>

<p>Screw that noise. I’ve moved my email to Google Apps and I’ve moved my website back to the other end of my DSL line at home.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there might still be a few things screwy with it. I’ll try to fix those when I get a chance. If you spot anything, leave a comment on the relevant page.</p>
