   <title>Linux empsync - manage Empeg music files</title>
</head>

<h2> empsync -- mirror .mp3 files from Linux
to the <a href="http://www.empeg.com">Empeg car player</a>.</h2>
This is a hacked-up front end to "<tt>emptool-1.01</tt>"
(from Empeg), which will mirror the contents of a Linux <tt>/mp3/artists/_all/</tt>
hierarchy onto an /artists/all playlist on the Empeg car player unit.
<p><a href="empsync.help">Read the (built-in) helpfile</a> first,
<br>Or <a href="empsync">fetch the code</a>
(single large gawk script), make it executable (<tt>chmod +x empsync</tt>),
and then run it by name.
<p>By default, it just prints out the built-in help and quits.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When run with appropriate options, it inspects your .mp3 files, compares
them with the Empeg, and uses <tt>emptool-1.01</tt> to prepare to update
the Empeg as needed.&nbsp; No changes are actually done unless the "sync"
option is also specified on the <tt>empsync</tt> command line.
<p>WARNING: perform several trial runs (without the "sync" option)
<br>to see what might happen <u>before</u> allowing it to
totally mess up your
<br>Empeg musical playlists (<i>not likely, but there may be bugs</i>).
<p>Use at your own risk -- I do, and it works for me.&nbsp; YMMV.

<p>I have other improvements under development, including
the ability to auto-generate alphabetical artist grouping and random album/track/genre
playlists for the Empeg.
<p>The current plan is for the playlist hierarchy to look
something like:
<br>&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/artists/_all/&lt;artists>/&lt;albums>/&lt;songs></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /artists/A-D/&lt;artists></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /artists/E-K/&lt;artists></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /artists/L-S/&lt;artists></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /artists/T-Z/&lt;artists></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /random/tracks/&lt;all_songs_shuffled></tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /random/albums/&lt;all_albums_shuffled></tt>
<p>All entries outside of /artists and /random are left alone
by the toolset,
<br>allowing user customizations to co-exist with the auto-generated stuff.
<p>Enjoy!
