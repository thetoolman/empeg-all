   <title>Linux mp3tool -- manipulate .mp3 headers</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>mp3tool -- examine / modify .mp3 headers under Linux.</h2>
<p>This tool can be used to display/extract/remove ID3v2
Tag information from .mp3 files, as well as audio headers and VBR information.&nbsp;
Modern .mp3 files downloaded from major web sites often include tens of
kilobytes of hidden header information, such as song Lyrics and images.&nbsp;
The mp3tool utility can be used to access these hidden "treasures" (aka.
disk space wasters).
<p>In particular, if you have a LOT of .mp3's and not much
storage space (as on the EMPEG car player or a portable .mp3 player), then
it may be useful to be able to remove all of the non-music from your music
files before downloading to the device.
<p>Also, there are a LOT of broken VBR (Variable Bit-Rate)
encoder programs out there (including RealJukeBox+) which do not always
write correct VBR headers into the .mp3 files they produce.&nbsp; This
can prevent your player from handling rewind/fastforward operations correctly,
among other problems.&nbsp; The mp3tool program can be used to fix such
problems.
