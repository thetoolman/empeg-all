<h2>
Detailed VolAdj Parameters
</h2>
Voladj parameters can be tweaked in the config.ini file, using sets of five integers, as follows:
<pre style=\"font-family: monospace, Courier\">
	voladjlow=0x1800,100,0x1000,25,60    ;default value shown
	voladjmed=0x2000,409,0x1000,27,70    ;default value shown
	voladjhigh=0x2000,3000,0xc00,30,80   ;default value_shown
</pre>
The meaning of each of these is described below:
<h4>factor/second</h4>
The rate of change of the volume. Expressed as a fixed point number, with the point 16 bits in. e.g. a factor of
two per second would be (2 << 16) 

<h4>minimum volume</h4>
This is the smallest volume that you would you like to hear, in sample size. 

<h4>headroom</h4>
After calculating the multiplier, it will be multiplied by this factor. This has the effect that large samples (especially
freak samples) are less likely to cause radical volume changes to avoid clipping. Expressed as a fixed point number like
factor/second. e.g. 0.75 is (3 << 14), 0.5 is (1 << 15) 

<h4>real silence</h4>
If the maximum sample size for a chunk is less than this amount, then it is assumed to be silence, so the volume is
gradually reduced back to normal. Expressed as a sample size. 

<h4>fake silence</h4>
If the maximum sample size for a chunk is equal to this amount, then it will try to scale it to the "minimum volume"
parameter above. If the size is between real silence and fake silence, it is treated as though it was fake silence.

<p>
From my old "Picker and Voladj for Dummies" readme file: 
<p>
The first parameter is the "factor per second". 
This is then shifted left 16 bits and expressed as 
an int. So to make voladj turn up the volume so 
that the output is increased by a factor of two 
every second, you set this to (2 << 16). Weird 
things can happen if you set this very high or 
very low, but it should be OK to give it sensible 
values. 
<p>
The second parameter is the minimum volume. It 
attempts to make this the quietest thing you hear. 
The units are sample magnitudes. If you set this 
to 0, then none of the other parameters should 
have any effect. If you set it to (1<<15)-1 then 
in theory everything should be the same volume, 
but more likely is that my log routines would get 
confused. Best to stick with numbers less than 
30000, I think. 
<p>
The third parameter is the "headroom". This 
attempts to reduce the number of times that a 
hasty volume correction is needed to prevent 
clipping. This is a fraction between 0 and 1, 
shifted left 16 bits and converted to an int.
You should probably set this to 1 << 16. 
<p>
The fourth parameter (real_silence) is the sample 
magnitude below which we assume that there is no 
listenable music present, so we gradually turn the 
volume back down. 
<p>
The fifth parameter (fake_silence) is the sample 
magnitude that will get mapped to minvol. This 
must be greater than real_silence.
<p>
If your samples are between real_silence and 
fake_silence, then they are treated as if they 
were of magnitude fake_silence. 
<p>
Note: 
Pass in the left shifted values (0x20000 for the 
first parameter). In an attempt to make it a bit 
easier to remember, sample magnitudes are just 
raw, and (possibly) fractional values are 
expressed as fixed point, with 16 bits to the 
right of the point. 
<p>
Editor's note: In the descriptions above, notations such 
as "2 << 16" represent a Left Bitshift operation. For 
instance, "2 << 16" represents 2 left-shifted 16 bits, 
which works out to hexadecimal 0x20000 or decimal 131072. 
<p>
You can pass either the 
hexadecimal values ( 0x20000 ) on the command line or their 
decimal equivalents ( 131072 ).  When using the hex values,
make sure to precede them with the 
"0x" prefix so that the software knows it's a hex number. 
Note that you can use the Windows Calculator in Scientific 
mode to convert numbers between decimal and hexidecimal if 
you need to.
