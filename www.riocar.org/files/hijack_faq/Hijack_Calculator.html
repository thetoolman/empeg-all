<H1>Hijack Calculator</H1>

<H2>Intro</H2>
The Hijack calculator allows you to perform basic calculations on your empeg, but it has 
some serious limitations:

<H3>Integer only</H3>
The calculator is integer only, both when entering numbers and when displaying results.
Any fractional part in a result is truncated. For instance 15/4 which should yeild 3.75 shows 3.
-15/4 shows -3.

<H3>Priorities</H3>
Operation is infix, ie you pick the operator between entering the numbers, opposed to 
postfix where you first enter the numbers and then the operator - common on HP calculators.
There is no prioritizing of */% over +- so an operation like 2+2*5 would yeild 20 (because it 
is done as 2+2=4 *5=20) instead of 2+(2*5)=12 as the normal priority rules dictate. 

<H2>Operation</H2>

<H3>Buttons</H3>
The calculator is controlled by the <B>Menu</B> and <B>Cancel</B> buttons (Rio remote) or the 
<B>CD</B> and <B>*</B> buttons (Kenwood remote) as well as the number buttons (<B>0</B> to <B>9</B>).
The <B>Menu/CD</B> button acts as operator selector and the <B>Cancel/*</B> as Clear Entered, 
Clear All and Quit.

<H3>Display</H3>
The available operations and corresponding buttons are listed as a guide at the top two lines of 
the screen in the following fashion: <BR>
Menu/CD: +-*/%= <BR>
Cancel/*: CE.CA.Quit <BR>
<BR>
The two lower lines display previous (partial) result and the number you're currently entering, 
respectively. <BR>
The currently selected operation is shown in the lower left hand corner.

<H3>Available functions</H3>
The available mathematical operations are
<ul>
<li>+ : addition
<li>- : subtraction
<li>* : multiplication 
<li>/ : division
<li>% : modulus
<li>= : end calculation
</ul>

<H3>Using <B>Cancel/*</B></H3>
To clear an erroneous number entry (ie you meant to press <B>5</B> but mistakenly pressed <B>2</B>), 
press <B>Cancel/*</B> once (CE, Clear Entered). The entire entered number is erased, not only the 
last digit. You can not in this situation press <B>Menu/CD</B> to change the selected operation - 
you can only enter another number.
<P>
If you press <B>Cancel/*</B> in the situation where the calculator expects either the first digit 
of a number or another <B>Menu/CD</B> press (to change operator), the previous result will be 
cleared (CA, Clear All).
</P>
Another press of <B>Cancel/*</B> in either situation above will quit to the Hijack menu.

<H2>Examples of operation</H2>
<P>
<H3>12+5</H3>
enter <B>1</B> <B>2</B> with the number keys, press Menu/CD to go to operator selection. 
+ is the first choice (default), so now you can enter the <B>5</B>. When you now press 
<B>Menu/CD</B> the operation is carried out and the result, 17, is available for further 
manipulation. If you want to start a new calculation (discarding the result) either repeatedly 
press <B>Menu/CD</B> until the indicated operation is <B>=</B> or press <B>Cancel/*</B>. 
Then enter the first number of the new calculation.
<P>
<H3>12*15</H3>
enter <B>1</B> <B>2</B> with the number keys, repeatedly (3 times) press <B>Menu/CD</B> to 
select the <B>*</B> operator.<BR>
Enter <B>1</B> <B>5</B> with the number keys, press <B>Menu/CD</B> to carry out the operation.<BR>
If you want to start a new calculation (discarding the result) either repeatedly press <B>Menu/CD</B>
 until the indicated operation is <B>=</B> or press <B>Cancel/*</B>. Then enter the first number of 
the new calculation.
<P>
<H3>(5+10-32)/5</H3>
enter <B>5</B> with the number keys, press <B>Menu/CD</B> once to select addition <BR> 
enter <B>1</B> <B>0</B> with the number keys, press <B>Menu/CD</B> twice to select subtraction (15 
is displayed)<BR>
enter <B>3</B> <B>2</B> with the number keys, press <B>Menu/CD</B> 4 times to select division 
(-17 is displayed) <BR> 
enter <B>5</B> with the number keys, Press <B>Menu/CD</B> (-3 is displayed, fractions are truncated)
<BR>
If you want to start a new calculation (discarding the result) either repeatedly press <B>Menu/CD</B> 
until the indicated operation is <B>=</B> or press <B>Cancel/*</B>. Then enter the first number of 
the new calculation.
<P>
<H3>(5+10)-32%5</H3>
This would have to be entered in a different order, to make the calculations in the correct priority
 order.<BR>
Press <B>Menu/CD</B> twice to select the <B>-</B> operator, enter <B>3</B> <B>2</B> with the number 
keys<BR> 
press <B>Menu/CD</B> 5 times to select the <B>%</B> operator <BR>
enter <B>5</B> with the number keys (-2 is displayed) <BR>
<B>+</B> is now selected (default), enter <B>5</B>, press <B>Menu/CD</B> (3 is displayed) <BR>
<B>+</B> is now selected (default), enter <B>1</B> <B>0</B> with the number keys, press 
<B>Menu/CD</B> (13 is displayed)
<P>
<H3>Continued operation on a result</H3>
If you wish to continue operating on a result (let's say multiplying 20 to the result of the last
example, (5+10)-32%5, above; do not select <B>=</B> and then press <B>Menu/CD</B>. 
Don't press <B>Cancel/*</B> either. <BR>
Instead just press <B>Menu/CD</B> another 2 times to select the <B>*</B> operator and then enter 
<B>2</B> <B>0</B> with the number keys and then press <B>Menu/CD</B> to perform the multiplication 
(260 is displayed)
